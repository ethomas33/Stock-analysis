# Stock-analysis
----------------------------------

##Overview of Project: 

This core deliverable of this project is a table that pulls for a select list of tickers the Total Daily Volume as well as the Return in a visually appealing manor that is easy to understand. This was then taking a few steps further by giving options such as pulling different years - 2017 or 2018. 

From here an analysis was done to see if refactoring the origional code could result in a faster responding project.

##Results: 

When we compare the results they are as follows: 

![2017_Origional](https://github.com/ethomas33/Stock-analysis/blob/8f2a657b4abc4180cffc5d5b8bc452884608aa3a/Resources/2017_O.png)

##Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.

What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?


How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
